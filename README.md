# cubes

This is intended to be a small project, giving me experience working with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and possibly building a website for "cubers".

On the site, there should be a [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube) in the middle, originally in a scrambled state. The cube can obviously be rotated to give a complete view. Users can then try to solve it using a touchscreen, a mouse or letters on the keyboard. Once completed there is a winning animation, showing move count and time taken.

To help with learning specific algorithms, users can look up solving methods and specific algorithms directly on site. They can also load a cube which is already partially solved, saving time trying to get to a spcific algotithm. If possible given my skills, there should also be a blind mode, hiding the colored faces to train for blindfolded solves.

I'd also like to get other cubes working, starting with differently sized cubes (e.g. 2x2 or 4x4) and working my way through different shapes ([pyraminx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyraminx), [megaminx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaminx), ...) possibly going up until puzzles like the [Square-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-1_(puzzle)). I can't guarantee anything though, since the inner workings of these puzzles get very complex and my be beyond my capabilities.
